# VR-Based_Product-Evaluation-System
 This repository contains a customizable Unity project designed for evaluating virtual product prototypes. It enables the collection of subjective data through a self-report questionnaire (semantic differential), along with eye-tracking and trajectory data. The project's built-in Python scripts will be used to analyze psychophysiological data, while the evaluation of semantic scales will be performed using external software, which remains the responsibility of the researcher.
